Workflow :
	1. Use libconfig to read the configuration file,
	   /etc/snares/snares.conf.
	2. Parse the URLs.
	3. Store them in a data structure.

	4. Create a systemd daemon.
	(5. Add daemon logging ???)

	6. Use libnetfilter_queue to intercept packets (using a callback,
	   I believe).
		TODO : Check how multiple packets are queued.

	7. Retrieve the packet data.
	8. Extract URL.
	9. Check for any matches from the block list.
	10. Drop the packet if it doesn't match any URLs blocked.
	    Else, let the packet pass.
	11. Make sure the dropped packets are logged.

	12. Ensure proper startup and shutdown.
	    Free resources before shutting down.
